# Rapido

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/starfighterheavy/rapido/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/starfighterheavy/rapido)

Rapido is a simple, highly opinionated library that can be included into your Rails controllers to enforce standardized behavior and security.

Documentation coming soon.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Testing

Run `rake` to execute the feature tests written for the sample application in the `test` directory.
